Assignment 1: Getting Acquainted with UNIX and C

--------------------
DESCRIPTION

This shell program produces two graphs as separate PDFs. The first half generates 100 random Monte Carlo estimations and plots their respective (x,y) values on a graph, highlighting points that fall within the circle as blue and red otherwise. The second plot consists of 4 independent Monte Carlo pi estimation graphs, each consisting of 70,000 random points.

BUILD

To build, run 'make' or 'make all' on the terminal command line within the assignment 1 directory. This creates a 'monte_carlo' executable file which can then be run.

CLEAN

Running 'make clean' will remove the 'monte_carlo' executable and the .io files from the assignment 1 directory.

RUNNING

Simply running './plot.sh' in the command line will output two PDFs of the described plots in the assignment 1 directory.
